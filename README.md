The Custom Image Gallery is a simple web-based application that allows users to view and navigate through multiple images interactively. One large image is displayed at a time, while smaller thumbnail images are shown below. Users can change the main image either by clicking on a thumbnail or by using Next and Previous navigation buttons.

This project is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and helps beginners understand basic image handling and DOM manipulation.
